      <p>
       Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by
       <b>
        Linus Torvalds
       </b>
       for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the
       <b>
        GNU General Public License
       </b>
       version 2.

       The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. While somewhat more complicated than the

      </p>
      <p>
       This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the

       . Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases. Of course, you also get to leverage all the benefits of the Feature Branch Workflow: pull requests, isolated experiments, and more efficient collaboration.

       After a while, you may notice that your Git commits and all that would be a tad slow and your local repository size may end up having incredibly slow commits, pushes and other Git operations. This section is meant for those who just want to get working with Git and do not want to expend too much effort with the workarounds detailed previously.

       One of the basic command that helps speed things up (not necessarily makes the local repository smaller) is :

          This command is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a "pack", into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing packs into a single, more efficient pack.
          <p>
           A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file.
          </p>
          <p>
           Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.
          </p>

        <tr>
         <td>
          <p>
           -a
          </p>
         </td>
         <td>
          Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects, pack everything referenced into a single pack. Especially useful when packing a repository that is used for private development. Use with -d. This will clean up the objects that git prune leaves behind, but git fsck --full --dangling shows as dangling.
          <p>
           Note that users fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch the whole new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how many other objects in that pack they already have locally.
          </p>
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>
          <p>
           -d
          </p>
         </td>
         <td>
          After packing, if the newly created packs make some existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs. Also run git prune-packed to remove redundant loose object files.
          <p>
           Note: This will ensure that redundant packs are consolidated to reduce space needed for your local repository.
          </p>
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>
          <p>
           --window=250
          </p>
         </td>
         <td rowspan="2">
          <p>
           These two options affect how the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against the other objects within --window to see if using delta compression saves space. --depth limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs to be applied that many times to get to the necessary object. The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50.

       The command above should help make Git operations faster without resorting to the workarounds described earlier.

       A good discussion and also notes on how to handle repositories with large files/blobs:

      <p>
       The method detailed here and also those in the linked articles within this section show that it is still possible to attain reasonable sizes and also performance simply by playing around with commands and so forth. This again, is ideal for people who want to just get started and do not necessarily want to perform the workarounds via git-annex and all that.
